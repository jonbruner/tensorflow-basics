# Tensorflow Basics
TensorFlow is great! Here are a few techniques I'm saving for future reference.

[save-load](save-load) illustrates the process for saving a TensorFlow model and weights, then reinstating it in a different application to either continue training or run the model. It took me a while to figure out a few details of this process, so I'm sharing it here in case it's useful to others. Once you've figured it out, saving and loading a model is very straightforward.

Begin with [Save](save-load/save.ipynb), which also includes a quick demo of TensorFlow's `feed` mechanism, then move on to [Load](save-load/load.ipynb) to see how to load a TensorFlow model in a new file.

Best,
Jon Bruner
